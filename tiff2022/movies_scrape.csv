An unpredictable oddity that tackles familiar tropes, themes, and modes of Nordic cinema, only to deliver a deeply melancholic, but utterly satisfying piece of muted, comic surrealism. A film which, in the words of the filmmaker, raises an important question: “What is hope in our world full of destruction and cynical approaches?” This can only be answered by a kind of cinema that is “metaphorical, open and profoundly layered in meaning.”"

Renowned Shakespearean theater director Peter Brook serves as producer and director. It includes many members of the Royal Shakespeare Company ... [who] become obsessed with a photograph of a wounded Vietnamese child and begin discussing the war with their friends and fellow actors... The discussions are combined with newsreel footage in a bizarre collage of images.

Instead of chasing sharks or running from giant boulders, Spielberg has Sammy navigating the interpersonal landmines of home and school life, in what may be the most emotionally expansive film of his career. Starting with gunslingers and war stories, the way any Boy Scout in the late 1950s might, Sammy/Spielberg shows us not only what sparked Spielberg’s love for cinema, but also how empathy and human relationships have sneaked their way into the work of this master filmmaker."

A beautiful, life-affirming film that shows us how to fight while restoring our faith to humanity."

In beDevil, what unfolds is three stories dominated by the metaphysical element and by references to the Australian tradition.

No Bears | Khers Nist,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14703,"In this year’s Venice Biennale, an empty seat was left for Jafar Panahi at the festival press conference. Currently in jail, the Iranian director has spent the past 12 years in and out of house arrest, banned from traveling or making films outside Iran, and faced with numerous obstacles making films at home. That hasn’t stopped him from delivering a film full of his ideas and anxieties. No Bears portrays two parallel love stories. In both, the lovers are troubled by hidden, inevitable obstacles, the force of superstition, and the mechanics of power. A piece of inventive, illuminating autofiction becomes an act of resistance (as any other film of the director), by simply narrating a story of escape: a couple who lives in a village close to the porous Iranian-Azeri borders tries to flee to Paris with stolen passports, a film crew following them, a second young couple trying to escape a forced marriage and a village full of gossips. A self-reflective masterpiece that highlights what is truly at stake when defending one’s creative freedom."

Rushing to the crime scene, she strikes up a conversation with an employee of her husband who also saw the crime. The two of them (magnificently played by Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jeanne Moreau, who was awarded at Cannes for her performance) speculate on the circumstances which led to the killing whilst toying subliminally with the idea of an affair. As desire intertwines with fear, obsession starts to emerge... A standout in Peter Brook’s filmography, this open reference to the spirit of Nouvelle Vague, co-scripted by Marguerite Duras and masterfully photographed by the prolific Armand Thirard, reeks with Camusian angst and ravishes with existential aesthetics."

Based on true events that took place in the 1980s, and entirely shot in the Nauvhal language, Tanna was a Best Foreign-Language Film Oscar nominee."

Boy from Heaven | Walad Min Al Janna,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14588,"Tarik Saleh brings on the screen the intimate ties between the Egyptian Church and State in a film brimming with paranoia, mystery, and conspiracies. Adam, a fisherman’s son, is offered the ultimate privilege to study at the Al-Azhar University in Cairo, the epicenter of the power of Sunni Islam. Shortly after his arrival in Cairo the university’s highest-ranking religious leader, the Grand Imam, suddenly dies and Adam soon becomes a pawn in a ruthless power struggle between Egypt’s religious and political elite. Reminiscent of Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose, Boy From Heaven unfolds a fascinating political thriller set in the heart of Egypt’s religious and secular institutions."
The Good Driver | The Good Driver,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14540,"Ivan, a Bulgarian taxi driver living at the Golden Sands tourist resort together with his best friend, is trying to save money in order to go to Finland to meet his wife and son. Ivan gets into trouble with local criminals and is forced to move back to his late mother’s house in his rugged childhood village by the Turkish border. This is where he starts working for the local mayor in the line of business he’s been trying to avoid. The film draws a picture of a Balkan man trying to cope with difficult circumstances and his own past mistakes. Maybe it is only friendship and loyalty that’ll help us when things get rough."
Victim | Obet,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14696,"When the son of Ukrainian immigrant Irina is attacked, the whole city stands up in solidarity with her family and condemns their Roma neighbors, who allegedly committed the crime. But soon another truth starts to emerge. Α suspenseful drama about a woman seeking justice in a racist society, torn between family and the search for the truth; a film that sheds new light onto the issue of the diasporic Ukrainian identity, which finds new resonances in this historic junction. In a fractured society, all people are victims."
Cobblers’ Lot | Cobblers’ Lot,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14598,"Very loosely based on a traditional Hungarian fairy tale, Peter Strickland’s contribution to the omnibus film The Field Guide to Evil, this is an abstract retelling of a folktale about two shoemaker brothers battling for the hand of a beautiful princess. Told in a silent movie style, with beautiful and ornate cards that spell out the story, Strickland’s singular vision is at its peak here. With characteristic grotesqueries coupled with a healthy sense of humor, this story perfectly closed out a weird and scary set of stories to haunt your dreams."
Katalin Varga | Katalin Varga,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14509,"Banished by her husband and her village, Katalin Varga is left with no other choice than to set out on a quest to find her son's real father, Orbán.

The Novelist’s Film | So-seol-ga-ui yeong-hwa,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14705,"A female novelist takes a long trip to visit a bookstore, run by a younger colleague who has fallen out of touch.

On Xerxes’ Throne | Στο Θρόνο του Ξέρξη,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14650,"A dystopian workplace at the Perama shipyards. A longstanding ban on physical contact has turned human interactions into otherworldly simulations. The suppression of touch among the workers has alienated their communication, transforming the boatyard into a charged landscape of alienation and repressed sensuality beyond stereotypical heteronormative desires."
A Love Song,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14469,"Faye, a modern, romantic, ascetic figure, leads an austerely simple life in a trailer parked beside an open lake, south of the Colorado Rockies. She catches shellfish for dinner and listens to the radio, following humble everyday rituals as she eagerly awaits the arrival of an important guest: the man she loved in her days of youth, with whom they share a legacy of pain and weeds. Time has carved a map on her face, which in turn reflects the rough, yet imposing landscape of Americana. A gentle, laconic film about contemplative introspection, the power of feelings, loss and longing, and the depths of melancholy, featuring a tour-de-force performance of the greatest character actors of our time. The heart – this lonely hunter – always invites us to sing along, even if we don't know the words."
Forever Young | Les Amandiers,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14678,"It’s the end of the 80s in Paris, and a young troupe of comedians has just been admitted to Les Amandiers, the prestigious theater school headed by Patrice Chéreau. They set out in life and in their early career. Along the way, they will learn, act, love, fear, live to the fullest, and also experience their first tragedy. The filmmaker and actress's semi-autobiographical look to acting and her love letter to a friend and colleague long gone, eschews bigger questions for more pressing emotions, channeling her mercurial performance style and feisty screen presence through a screen language that asks if nostalgia is really all that it's supposed to be."
That Kind of Summer | Un été comme ça,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14663,"The phrase “Hypersexuality is Not a Disease“ could be written over the entrance of the film’s quiet social institution, located next to a calm lake, where somber Léonie, impulsive Eugénie, and flirty Geisha are to spend a month-long voluntary retreat in the purpose of mastering their sexual obsessions. Supervised by a female German therapist and a male social worker, the three girls spend their days caught between fantasy and reality, past and future, desire and trauma. Denis Côté places female sexuality at the forefront and explores erotic obsessions, carnal desire, and rarely-heard intimate thoughts in a delicate yet raw and direct way that ultimately seeks to discuss the process of self-awareness."
Something in the Dirt,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14468,"Levi has snagged a no-lease apartment sight unseen in the Hollywood Hills to crash at while he ties up loose ends for his exodus from Los Angeles. He quickly strikes up a rapport with his new neighbor John, swapping stories like old friends under the glowing, smoke-filled skies of the city. One day, Levi and John witness something impossible in one of their apartments. Terrified at first, they soon realize this could change their lives and give them a purpose. With dollar signs in their eyes, these two random dudes will attempt to prove the supernatural."
Astor Place | Astor Place,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14607,"“Passersby at Astor Place in New York City speak silent volumes as they move by the mirrored surface of a diner window. I wanted to capture the unscripted choreography of the street, its dance of gazes and riddle of identities. This film is informed by the work of the Lumiere brothers, with an eye to permeating an authority of the static camera and establishing a question as to who is watching whom.” (Eve Heller)"
Behind This Soft Eclipse | Behind This Soft Eclipse,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14609,"I was imagining a collaboration of parallel worlds or a kind of doubled consciousness, a sense of the corporeal and the riddle of absence. The body of the film depends on a spine of interlocking contrasts in the form of negative and positive space, day and night shots, under and above water elements. These are cut on motion and qualities of light that are sometimes gentle and sometimes jarring, to convey the tender labor of hosting a balance. A crossing of paths behind the seen in the wake of one who no longer walks the curve of the world. Eclipse is an elegy for Marion McMahon who co-founded the Film Farm (Independent Imaging Retreat) in Southern Ontario, where it was produced. (Eve Heller)"
Creme 21 | Creme 21,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14610,"The stars are going haywire. A vision of heavenly bodies in wild disarray recurs in Eve Heller’s Creme 21. Assembled out of found moving images procured from old features and educational movies, Heller’s film begins and ends with a tunnel vision of outer space. From the suspended state of an astronaut we return to earth, fleeting shadows animate rooms, a slime-covered man is raised to his feet. Two eyes open hesitantly; we see how they begin to see. After the silent black and white prologue, sound and color are tuned in. Brief fragments of music and spoken commentary are strung together in the form of a cut-up, accompanied by the soft audio clicks of close to a thousand tape-spliced edit points – a symphony of shattered sentences and synthetic/exotic sound collages."
Her Glacial Speed | Her Glacial Speed,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14608,"“Unwitting constellations of meaning rise to a surface of understanding at a place outside of worldly time. This premise becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. An unexpected interior unfolds, made palpable by a trauma that remains abstract. The world as seen in a teardrop of milk.” (Eve Heller)"
Juice | Juice,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14605,"“A slow motion blow-up to 35mm foregrounds the kinetic serendipity of a handhold portrait shot in 1980 and entirely edited in-camera. At the time I explored the groundbreaking portability and technical features of Super 8 to capture the wild intensity of my dog Juice as we played in a down-and-out neighborhood in Buffalo, New York. In 2009, I treated the film as an objet trouvé – without bettering its formal quirks and lags – documenting the so-called ‘amateur’ nature of the medium and an unselfconscious phase of filmmaking practice.” (Eve Heller)"
Last Lost | Last Lost,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14606,"A hypnotic parable about coming of age in a shifty world of slipping terms, “found” in the optically mesmerized fragments of a home market movie about a chimpanzee’s high adventures at Coney Island. A new story is rendered from the filmic vocabulary of the lighthearted original by moving in on background details, slowing down fleeting actions and shifting the psychology of the frame. A silent film in spirit, trying to speak without words, like some dreams. (Eve Heller)"
One | One,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14603,"The first film I ever made consists of the first roll of film I ever shot, entitled One. I made it for the first film class Keith Sanborn taught, in 1978 at the Department of Media Studies at the University of Buffalo, when he was a graduate student working with Hollis Frampton. I was 17. The assignment was to make a film using one roll of Super 8 film, without moving the camera. The result is a kind of poetic/cinematic one-liner. It is in tune with the structuralist spirit of the day – to my surprise. (Eve Heller)"
Self-Examination Remote Control | Self-Examination Remote Control,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14604,"A fragile Super 8 self-portait rediscovered on 35mm, made by a struggling nineteen-year-old discontented with the pseudo-Brakhagean spectacle presented by her fellow students at the end of the 1970s. I shot with remote control and intercut magnetic striped passages of black to record my quandary. The paradoxical predicament of being both subject and object in myself resulted in a film that represents a perhaps obligatory phase of cinematic narcissism in the early work of an aspiring avant-garde filmmaker. (Eve Heller)"
Singing in Oblivion | Singing in Oblivion,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14611,"A magnificent visual and musical poem, simultaneously timeless and in delicate synchronicity with our devastating present. (Nicole Brenez)"
How is Katia? | Yak tam Katia?,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14559,"Inspired by the principles of social realism, the director films a harsh society that imposes impossible choices on its members. Anna is a 35-year-old ambulance driver and single mother who lives in a cramped apartment with her young daughter, Katia, and her aging mother. When Katia is accidentally hit by a passing car that belongs to a well-connected and wealthy local politician, the film delves into a story of social injustice and revenge and reveals how flexible moral principles can be in a society governed by the “right of the strongest.” The film examines the gray area of personal morality, leading to a stark realization of how easy it is to abandon expected “civilized” behaviors and habits when faced with extreme circumstances."
Blanquita,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14600,"One of the most dramatic cases that shook the public life of Chile and held the nation in suspense for nine months, inspires a powerful melodrama demonstrating the way popular media affected the outcome of a violent story involving the children of powerful people. Blanca, an 18-year-old foster home resident, is the key witness in a scandal involving kids, politicians, and rich men taking part in sex parties. Yet, the more questions are asked, the less clear it becomes what Blanca’s role in the scandal exactly is. A story about the double life of a girl whose lack of opportunities and constant letdown by the very institutions which promised to protect her, pushed her to the limits. An inquiry about personal truth, deception, ethics, and the interpretation of truth."
Trenque Lauquen - Part II | Trenque Lauquen - Part II,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14707,"In her dazzling and enormously pleasurable new opus, Laura Citarella takes the viewer on a limitless, mercurial journey through stories nested within stories set in and around the Argentinean city of Trenque Lauquen (“Round Lake”) and centered on the strange disappearance of a local academic named Laura. Through initial inquiries by two colleagues – older boyfriend Rafael and a driver named Ezequiel with whom she had grown secretly close – we learn about her recent discoveries, including a new, unclassified species of flower and a series of old love letters hidden at the local library, which may help them track her down. Yet as flashbacks and anecdotes pile up, we begin to realize that this intricately structured tale is larger and stranger than we could have imagined. Citarella, a producer of the equally remarkable shape-shifting epic La Flor, has confidently crafted a series of interlocked romantic, biological, and ecological mysteries that create parallels between past lives and present dangers, invoke the rapture of obsessive pursuit, and salute the human need to find personal freedom and happiness. Trenque Lauquen is told in 12 chapters spread across two feature films."

Coming Attractions | Coming Attractions,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14618,"Coming Attractions and the construction of its images are woven around the idea that there is a deep, underlying relationship between early cinema and avant-garde film. Tom Gunning was among the first to describe and investigate this notion in a systematic and methodical manner in his well-known and often quoted essay: ""An Unseen Energy Swallows Space: The Space in Early Film and Its Relation to American Avant-Garde Film"" (in John L. Fell [ed.], Film Before Griffith, Berkeley 1983)."
Happy-End | Happy-End,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14616,"Α found footage film about oral rituals (…), about seasonal celebrations, and about a married couple, who quite obviously understand how to enrich and enliven companionship. We see a pair pouring drinks, cutting cakes, drinking toasts...(Bert Rebhandl). I wanted to bestow the couple a dignified resurrection and organized the footage so that, temporally speaking, the material runs in reverse and the players are steadily rejuvenated. (…) The finale is reached with the woman’s spirited dance that culminates in a freeze-frame, her face expressing an equal measure of joy and pain. Between egg-nog and Sachertorte, the vanity of human existence rears its head. Ultimately Happy-End is a tragicomedy. (Peter Tscherkassky)"
Manufracture | Manufraktur,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14614,"A tangled network is woven with particles of movement derived from found footage and compiled anew: the grammatical elements “to the left, to the right, back and forth” of narrative space are discharged of all semantic burden. What remains is a self-sufficient swarm of fleeting vectors, furrowed with traces of the manual processes of darkroom production. (Peter Tscherkassky)"
Nachtstueck (Nocturne) (Mozart Minute 09) | Nachtstück (Mozart Minute 09),/en/movie-tiff/movie/14617,"We glide into Mozart’s “Eine kleine Nachtmusik,” soon to abandon standardized paths of conventional representational film and encounter a few seconds of passionate sensorial film – an example of what I would like to call “physical cinema.” The thesis: Mister Mozart would have enjoyed it. (Peter Tscherkassky)"
Parallel Space: Inter-View | Parallel Space: Inter-View,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14615,"Parallel Space: Inter-View by Peter Tscherkassky is a thoroughly singular masterpiece. It is a film about memory, the way images coalesce, perspectives dissolve and events fall apart, only to be reassembled in an entirely new context. It is a film by and about film, video, computer, men, women, children, sex, longing and clarity – you feel what it is about directly, without thinking. Whatever is written in regard to this film can at best only provide an intellectual approximation; the experience of this film is incomparable. (Olaf Möller)"
The Exquisite Corpus | The Exquisite Corpus,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14619,"It is with deceptive simplicity that Peter Tscherkassky embarks on his filmic voyage to regions of desire found in sexualized cinema: A naked couple from a 1960s nudist film climbs aboard a small sailboat, gliding over darkly tinged waters alongside a rocky coastline before stumbling on an isolated beach where a sleeping beauty lays. It takes nearly four minutes to arrive at this juncture before Tscherkassky blows his fuses in characteristic style. Images begin to flicker and tremble, intermingling and superimposing, nervously shimmering between positive and negative, diving headlong into over-, under-, and multiple exposures, split screens, and distortion effects. The title of The Exquisite Corpus not only refers to the surrealist method of artmaking called cadavre exquis, but also tips its hat to the colloquial German term for a fine funeral or “schöne Leiche” – photochemical cinema is almost an anachronism in this day and age."
Eismayer,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14534,"Sergeant Major Eismayer is known and feared as the toughest training officer in the Austrian Armed Forces, ruthless with recruits and unwavering in his discipline, order, and macho toughness. But when he starts to fall in love with Falak, a new recruit who unashamedly embraces his homosexuality, Eismayer‘s closeted existence is shaken to the core. To a man like Eismayer, loving another man cannot be reconciled with the understanding of what a model soldier should be. Will he choose to protect his badass tough guy image over all else, or can he follow his heart and his true desire? A surprising, heartfelt film Inspired by a true story."
Medea | Μήδεια,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14634,"Medea, Jason, and their two children live as refugees in the Greek city of Corinth. When Jason abandons her to marry the king’s daughter, Medea is forced to leave the country, on penalty of death."

Intoxicated by the prospect of a place to finally call home, he gathers his found family of brothers – five boys scavenging on the streets of Medellin – and together they embark on a journey across a landscape whose lush forests and inveigling mists conceal a pandemic of pervasive violence. Along the way, they encounter others inhabiting the margins of a society in turmoil, who alternatively offer lessons in courage and kindness, brutality and greed. Swinging between unbridled delirium and bitter reality, this kaleidoscopic road movie follows an at-once surreal and perilous odyssey into the legacies of violence in contemporary Colombia. A film about the disobedience, friendship, and dignity that exist in resistance. A journey to nowhere, where everything happens."

Birdwatchers | Birdwatchers,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14555,"Marco Bechis’ Birdwatchers is taking us to Mato Grosso do Sul, in Brazil, where landowners live in luxury, spending their nights with the tourists who visit the area for birdwatching. Meanwhile, just outside their properties, the agitation of the indigenous people who were once the legal owners of this land is increasingly burning. Exiles in reservation sites, with no prospect other than working as modern-day slaves on sugar plantations, many young members of the indigenous community are driven to suicide. One such incident will spark the flame of resistance, when a Guarani-Kaiowá indigenous group sets camp outside of a property, asking for what is theirs. But apart from rage, the conflicting sides experience feelings of charm and curiosity for the “Other” standing before them. A curiosity that will trigger a profound bond between a young Saman student and the daughter of a landowner – a relationship that becomes a beacon of hope and faith in the power of the universe, providing us with an alternative definition of climate activism."
Ngāti | Ngāti,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14505,"Barry Barclay’s Ngāti is the first feature film written and directed by a Maori artist. The film depicts a post-colonial New Zealand of the 1940s, where the peaceful coexistence among the white and the Maori populations is still a distanced illusion. A young Australian doctor arrives in a coastal village, seemingly searching for his origins. As the locals welcome him with open arms, he observes how they stick together like one fist, at a time when the local factory is one step before closure and the area one step before withering. Initially assured of all the things he has to teach to the Maoris, the doctor will soon realize that he is the one who has much to learn by the traditions, the mentality and the community feel of the indegenous people. This simple and captivating story about a man on the search for his identity, is a landmark in the history of indigenous cinema."

After an initial welcome, he experiences an increasing number of tense interactions and is reluctantly dragged into local politics. When Emre forms a bond with the owner of the local newspaper pressure escalates under heated rumors. Explosive from its very first scene, when a vast hole in the ground drives us into a universe of violence and blood, and fixating till the end credits, this intense allegory about homosociality and power invents a new language to decry the makings of a society which is dominated by men, and to discuss their inner conflict."

Amidst a chorus of voices of accusers, supporters, and a largely hypocritical public, a single committed journalist takes on the task of piecing together the truth, between secrecy and desire, facing suspicion and censorship in the process. In the words of the director, this is “[a] film about violence and the obtuseness of prejudice. About love subjected to conformism and hypocrisy. A cross-section of Italian provincial life in the pivotal sixties, when economic wellbeing did not grow at the same pace as awareness about things. As emotional openness. The family is a closed space where intergenerational disagreements remain heated and conflictual... The film aims to instill the courage to rebel.”"
GUO4 | GUO4,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14512,"A confrontation between two swimmers in a locker room ends in tears in this highly imaginative morality tale.

And while her childhood is shattered forever, she is finally able to walk into the future unafraid. A unique hybrid of VFX, live action, puppetry, and animation, Blaze is an ode to female courage and a celebration of the power of the imagination."
Sami Blood | Sameblod,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14546,"Α declaration of love to those who left and those who stayed in a society at the edge of the world, and an alternative, insider’s story of the colonial past of a “civilized” country, through the eyes of a teenager. Elle Marja, 14, is a reindeer-breading Sámi girl. Exposed to the racism of the 1930s and race biology examinations at her boarding school, she starts dreaming of another life. To achieve this other life she has to become someone else and break all ties with her family and culture."
Concerned Citizen,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14480,"Concerned Citizen reverses typical social hierarchies and shows the events that lead a gay character to become the cause of violence against another minority, a group of Eritrean immigrants. Ben thinks of himself as a liberal and enlightened gay man who lives a happy life in the perfect apartment with his boyfriend Raz and only misses a baby to complete the ideal bourgeois picture. However, his view of himself is fundamentally challenged when his well-meaning and eco-friendly actions lead to the brutal police arrest of an immigrant. Idan Haguel explores white guilt in a satirical parable that underscores latent prejudices and the hypocrisy of white privilege."
Other People | Inni Ludzie,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14665,"An urban drama about Kamil, a wannabe-rapper who should be getting his life and career going but instead gets high, roams around the city and starts an affair with a bored, rich housewife Iwona. It’s a polyphonic story about isolated people dreaming of love in the big city, a fresh, funky, and dark tale of modern society existing in the shadow of capitalism, where other people – neighbours, commuters, and passersby, become a modern incarnation of a Greek chorus, voicing the inner anger and frustration of the protagonists."
Lord of the Flies | Lord of the Flies,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14646,"Following a plane crash, a group of schoolboys find themselves on a deserted island. They appoint a leader and attempt to create an organized society for the sake of their survival. Democracy and order soon begin to crumble when a breakaway faction regresses to savagery with horrifying consequences. An adaptation of Nobel Prize-winner William Golding’s 1954 dystopian novel, which investigates mankind’s inherent savagery (and a cinematic translation of Brook’s legendary stage adaptation), the film leads the viewer from hope to disaster, with the same awe and hesitation an insect is drawn to light."
World War III | Jang-e Jahani Sevom,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14538,"Shakib is a homeless day laborer who never got over the loss of his wife and son in an earthquake years ago. The construction site on which he works today turns out to be the set of a film about the atrocities committed by Hitler during WWII. Against all odds, he is given a movie role, a house, and a chance at being somebody. But even though the film is meant to deliver a harsh critique of dictatorships, the filmmakers themselves turn into tyrants who would do anything to achieve their goals. Shakib turns irreversibly into a terrifying monster... Reiterating one of Mark Twain’s most famous quotes (“History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes”) and alluding to an obscure saying by Hana Arendt (“in dictatorships, everything goes well up until 15 minutes before total collapse”), one of the most prolific figures in Iranian cinema delivers a multi-layered, self-reflective comment on making myth or history, on the boundaries of authorship and authority."
Dream Work | Dream Work,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14624,"Dream Work does not so much present dream content than filmic methods of representation corresponding to Freudian dreamwork: mechanisms of displacement and condensation are seen in relation to figurative elements found in Tscherkassky’s source material. Tscherkassky processes these in a manner that resembles Freud’s description of the compression (Pressung) of dream thoughts that takes place in the work of dreams, whereby “components are turned, crumble, and get pushed together, like drift ice.” (Christa Blümlinger)"
Get Ready | Get Ready,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14621,"This little film of revised found feature film shots doesn’t need more than sixty seconds to prove that cinema is a first class medium for both the idle and the busy. An artfully composed idyll by the sea, uneventful, just like an image from a dream, is sped up and transformed into a nightly ghost ride, driving against traffic down a busy street, through flickering black and white oscillations, toward the glaring headlights of a car – or that of a film projector. (Stefan Grissemann)"
Instructions for a Light and Sound Machine | Instructions for a Light and Sound Machine,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14625,"Tscherkassky concentrates on central motifs from Sergio Leone’s classic The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, zeroing in on Eli Wallach stumbling across a vast cemetery and the anti-hero’s head as he dangles from the gallows. Tscherkassky intercuts the latter image with countdown leader, ironically delaying the saving bullet shot by Clint Eastwood. Hereby the very film tears and suddenly descends into pure, soundless whiteness. Only by way of its defects is the medium of film made tangible. The flaws in the system – blisters, scratches, distortions and cracks – overwhelm and overlay the narrative, shatter the illusion and give rise to a richly ambiguous, new story. (Stefan Grissemann)"
L’ Arrivée | L’ Arrivée,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14622,"Although by no means a conventional narrative, and certainly a film inspired by the avant-garde’s simultaneous engagement with formal abstraction and material energy, L’Arrivée also engages with the history and form of narrative cinema. Certainly, its role in that relation is a critical one, revealing both the mechanism and the material that commercial cinema strives to conceal. But while engaged in a process of deconstruction, L’Arrivée also recognizes the power of cinema, utilizing its control over space, and in this film especially, time, in order to uncover the energies of motion and story, of the violence inherent in both revolt and containment. (Tom Gunning)"
Outer Space | Outer Space,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14623,"A woman, terrorized by an invisible and aggressive force, is also exposed to the audience’s gaze, a prisoner in two senses. Outer Space agitates this construction, which is prototypical for gender hierarchies and classic cinema’s viewing regime, and allows the protagonist to turn them upside down. (…) The story ends in the woman’s resistant gaze. (Isabella Reicher)"

This third film in my “Rushes Series” is an homage to Kurt Kren that simultaneously taps into a classic motif in film history. My darkroom ride took a few years, but we finally arrived: All aboard!

LOLA,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14523,"What if David Bowie’s Space Oddity could be listened to back in 1941? That’s just one of many questions raised by LOLA, a film true to science fiction's key preoccupation with technology, its promises of infinite prosperity, and its destructive consequences. With striking black-and-white imagery and 16mm shots that feel all-too authentic, the film delves into an alternative timeline where sisters Thom and Mars invent a machine that can intercept radio and TV broadcasts from the future. When World War II breaks out, ethics clash with responsibility as the sisters must now decide how to use their knowledge – known to be the ultimate form of power."
Butterfly Vision | Bachennya metelyka,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14514,"Moving away from typical glorious and patriotic (male) war stories, Buttefly Vision focuses on the condition of female soldiers who may have to face things worse than death. After spending months as a prisoner in Donbas, Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance expert Lilia returns home to her family. However, memories and feelings from her past captivity continue to torment her and resurface in dreamlike ways. While unable to forget, Lilia refuses to identify as a victim and instead starts a new struggle, this time to liberate herself. With this film, Maksym Nakonechnyi explores the haunting and often surreal dimensions of individual trauma, that here reflect the collective trauma of a country devasted by war, violence and hatred."
The Uncle | Stric,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14513,"The film appears to be set in the late 1980s Yugoslavia, as a family welcomes their beloved uncle, who has returned home from Germany for the holidays. The reunited family enjoys the Christmas lunch until a smartphone starts ringing. It’s a sign that it is not the 1980s, it’s not quite Christmas time either, and it is not just the served turkey that can be cut with a knife – the tension can too. A sharp chamber thriller that plays an imaginative game challenging the boundaries of truth, representation, and memory of the past."

Spanning 20 years from their arrival in France, Leonor Serraille’s follow-up to her Camera d’Or-winner Jeune Femme (Cannes 2017) is the moving chronicle of the construction and deconstruction of a family. A poetic elegy on coming-of-age as an unearthly process, is at the same time a sensitive and complex inspection of the imaginary boundary between childhood and adulthood, innocence and experience – led by a superb female performance and vibrating with emotion and an invincible sense of freedom."

A few days later, his wife, with the help of her lover, kills him, buries him in the garden, and tells everyone that he has gone back to Germany. The man’s sudden departure makes the villagers suspicious and soon the police arrive. That is the crux of the story that will develop through different investigations: the one conducted by the bureaucracy (the examining magistrate) which wants to find a perpetrator and close the case; and the one conducted by a group of journalists, which by recording the testimonials of the villagers, highlights the sociological framework that generated these events, as well as the dramatic social reality of the village which remains an open wound."

After returning to her parents’ home without her daughter, whom Hasan decided to keep, Meri realizes she is trapped in a wicked circle of provincial laws and rules, and her family’s needs and ambitions. Trying to find herself, Meri auditions for a film that is to be shot in the neighborhood. Adapted from a famous South Slavic folk ballad, this optimistic exploration of love, freedom, and art, renders in cinema the tumbling pathos of a slow, emotive song. Through the rhythmical transition between realistic sequences and more experimental interludes, and from comical confrontations to moments of contemplation, the film invites us to follow the pace of a beating heart."

Empire of Light feels like a love letter to seventh art, and the story follows two employees of an English coast cinema, Hilary and Stephen, who find refuge in each other. Mendes hand-picks the songs of his film, such as “Too Much Too Young” by The Specials and “Mirror in the Bathroom” by The Beat or “Love Will Tear Us Apart” by Joy Division and “Spellbound” by Siouxsie and the Banshees. The result is an emotional ode to music and cinema, a personal film that evokes a “golden” past, without, however overlooking the larger social issues of the time."

The main topic of each issue would be a conversation (in the form of an interview) between two auteurs, either of cinema or theater. Theo Angelopoulos and Nikos Panayotopoulos were chosen by the editorial board for the first issue. The two of them were indisputably the key figures of Greek cinema at the time, and they were also placed among the pioneers of New Greek Cinema. In this context, Antonis Kokkinos and Yannis Soldatos recorded a three-hour interview between Theo and Nikos, on a summer evening at Angelopoulos’s house in the area of Mati, by the sea of Attica. The interview brought to the fore their shared trajectory, but also the different routes they followed from one point onwards, starting from their years in Paris and moving to their spectacularly failed attempt to prepare Angelopoulos’s first film – In the short film The Forminx, Panayotopoulos worked as an assistant director. Thirty-five years later, this previously unreleased conversation was traced in-between tapes and transcripts! Given that the two protagonists have passed away, this conversation stands as a valuable piece of documentation of the creators’ perspective on their own work (both the existing and the future), as well as a thorough insight into New Greek Cinema and world cinema by and large."

Berberian Sound Studio | Berberian Sound Studio,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14510,"1976: Berberian Sound Studio is one of the cheapest, sleaziest post-production studios in Italy. Only the most sordid horror films have their sound processed and sharpened in this studio. Gilderoy, a naive and introverted sound engineer from England is hired to orchestrate the sound mix for the latest film by horror maestro, Santini. Thrown from the innocent world of local documentaries into a foreign environment fuelled by exploitation, Gilderoy soon finds himself caught up in a forbidding world of bitter actresses, capricious technicians and confounding bureaucracy. The longer Gilderoy spends mixing screams and the bloodcurdling sounds of hacked vegetables, the more homesick he becomes for his garden shed studio in his hometown of Dorking. His mother’s letters alternate between banal gossip and an ominous hysteria, which gradually mirrors the black magic of Santini’s film. As both time and realities shift, Gilderoy finds himself lost in an otherworldly spiral of sonic and personal mayhem, and has to confront his own demons in order to stay afloat in an environment ruled by exploitation both on and off screen."
Berberian Sound Studio (short version) | Berberian Sound Studio (short version),/en/movie-tiff/movie/14596,"Two foley artists make sound effects for a cheap B-movie.

Tommy Guns | Nação Valente,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14580,"In 1974, after years of civil war, the Portuguese and their descendants fled the colony of Angola where independentist groups gradually claimed their territory back. While a tribal girl discovers love and death when her path crosses that of a young Portuguese soldier, a group of Portuguese soldiers barracked inside an infinite wall are called to escape once the past comes out of the grave to claim its long-awaited justice. Borrowing its original title from the lyrics of Portugal’s national anthem, this visually arresting and uncompromising film is at once a relentless study of colonialism and a parable of the devastation of warfare. Blending genres and tones, this imagi-nation in chiaroscuro is an ode to male beauty and mortality, vaguely alluding to the quasi-metaphysical cinema of Pedro Costa."
Broadway | Broadway,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14629,"Nelly has escaped from her wealthy and controlling family.

Men of Deeds | Oameni de treabă,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14518,"Ilie, a small-town police chief, wants to build a modest, comfortable life for himself, but ends up making the wrong choices. Middle-aged and alienated, he feels the need to be a part of something – to build an orchard, even a home. Although dubious things happen in the village, Ilie only sees what suits him. The moment he gets involved in the village marks the beginning of his collapse. In a vacuum of solutions, he tries to be what he has never been before: the justice seeker who arrests everyone guilty. A nuanced, ironic, exploration of the foundations of toxic masculinity and the inability (or unwillingness) to fit the traditional social standards, featuring one of the best performances in contemporary Romanian cinema."
Godland | Vanskabte Land - Volaða Land,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14677,"At the end of the 19th century, a young Danish priest travels to a remote part of Iceland to build a church and to photograph its people. But the deeper he penetrates into the inner of this imposing place, the further away he diverts from his purpose, his mission and his morals. One of the most sensational films that premiered in this year's Cannes (Un Certain Regard competition), the mystic Godland by Icelander Hlynur Pálmason, poses every huge supernatural and existential question (human's place within nature and the universe, faith and fear of God, the quest for what connects us with the Other, reconciliation with death as a means of overcoming agony), utilizing an impressive film discourse that reminds us from Terrence Malick to Dreyer and Bergman, and from (the similarly thematic) Silence by Martin Scorcese to the magnificent Calvary by John Michael McDonaugh. A film experience that one more so lives through than merely watches, but made for the big screen, despite its overall magnitude."
Blank Narcissus (Passion of the Swamp) | Blank Narcissus (Passion of the Swamp),/en/movie-tiff/movie/14592,"An aging porno director (played by Michael Brandon from Dario Argento’s Four Flies on Grey Velvet) makes a commentary in 2022 for the DVD of an underground 16mm film he made in 1972 and was recently rediscovered.

Flux Gourmet | Flux Gourmet,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14475,"Peter Strickland’s fifth feature takes place in an art residency led by an upper-class aesthete who has invited a culinary collective to perform their “sonic catering” practice for a month. Hired to report on their creative process, a Greek writer begins to suffer from indigestion, to which the institution’s sarcastic doctor responds by advising him to “let food be his medicine.” While his intestinal disorders force him to acknowledge his own malaise, the collective is undermined by internal quarrels as well as external assaults from a group of sardonic, rejected candidates. Strickland’s gory comedy reconnects the image with those organic processes that art usually deems to be impure and unacceptable. Not as a provocation, but to remind us that the imagination should not be seen as separate from the natural realm."

The encounter with instructor Afonso, a young black man/dancer from the fire brigade, opens a new chapter in the lives of the two young men, who dive deep into love and desire with the will to change the status quo. One of the most idiosyncratic directors of our time revisits the musical comedy genre only to experiment with its limits. João Pedro Rodrigues embraces social and cinematographic stereotypes and twists them in new directions. The result is a fresh and witty film, full of love, both romantic and physical, music, and theatre."

A classic comedy dominated by women, which brings together actors and non-actors in a lively, fragmented story – a subtle and witty homage to one of the most photogenic capitals of Europe, which discovers bygone splendor in ordinary things."

In response, Signe makes a desperate attempt to regain her status by creating a new persona hell-bent on attracting attention and sympathy. a film about a dysfunctional, toxic relationship – an ‘anti-rom-com’ destined to be influential, is a scathing portrait of nihilistic narcissism that taps into similar deadpan humor but walks a much more precarious tightrope between uncomfortable satire and plain cruelty."

Axiom,/en/movie-tiff/movie/14479,"An intense and intellectually dizzying drama about the contemporary human condition, centered on Julius, an eloquent and charming young museum attendant loved by his friends and colleagues. However, it takes only the tiniest crack to reveal the psychological abyss that lurks beneath the surface. Axiom presents a fascinating exploration of the disquieting contradiction between the modern ideals of self-reinvention and behavioral patterns in conflict with the rules of society. In the spirit of Luigi Pirandello'σ Right You Are (if you think so), the film questions the very existence of an “identity”; in a success-driven world that values appearances over essence, or, in other words, that asks us to “fake it till you make it.”"

Following the conflict between two Indian families of common ancestry (the descendants of the gods of earthly harmony, patience, and wisdom, and their eternal dark rivals), the screen adaptation of a monumental nine-hour production that helped redefine theater, is a profound, breathtaking, and inspiring expression of mankind’s attempt to make sense of the often baffling and terrifying human experience; at the same time, it illuminates which values are essential for human survival and fulfillment. And as its bearded creator and storyteller says to an inquiring youth in the beginning, “Mahabharata is the poetical history of mankind... If you listen carefully, in the end, you’ll be someone else.”"

The news of Pinochet’s decision to ban pasturing in the area becomes the turning point of their silent struggle to preserve their way of life.

Up there he meets Léa, a chef of an alpine restaurant, while mysterious glows glitter in the deep mountains… Actor-director Thomas Salvador (who has always dreamt of becoming a mountain guide) gives a tour-de-force performance in this astonishing work, even though the real protagonist is the frozen, imposing landscape of Mont Blanc.

A highly timid film, reaching immense depths of ambition."
